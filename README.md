# Pandemic-Go
This is a 2D platformer game I made with Cocos Creator during COVID-19 in early 2023. Players would maneuver a masked player over the mass of a deserted suburb plagued by viruses. The hero would have to dodge his own friends to fend off the infectious virus, but he would simultaneously find himself emotionally distanced from other people. I hope to convey the anxiety I felt during the pandemic and stress the importance of relationships and connections during a time of crisis.

Below are videos of the game.
